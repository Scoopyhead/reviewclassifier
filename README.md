# Spam Detection in Restaurant Reviews

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets for a spam detection project focused on identifying fraudulent or deceptive restaurant reviews. The project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with PyTorch, specifically leveraging LSTM networks enhanced with self-attention mechanisms to distinguish genuine reviews from spam.

## Features
- **Data Processing**: Scripts to clean and prepare the dataset for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of LSTM and self-attention models in PyTorch.
- **Evaluation**: Code to assess model performance with precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Scoopyhead/reviewclassifier.git
cd reviewclassifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
